# ReactPortafolio


I deployed the app on heroku due to the incompatibility of gh-pages with browser-router. I thought of creating a component that had a switch function for the route issue, but I preferred to use react-router-dom to have better web performance and this seemed more professional to me.

The contact form is completly functional and when hover over portfolio images, these will display a short description and technologies used in the project. 

Also you're able to download my resume by clicking the pdf image.

# Technologies

The web was developed with react-bootstrap, also used CSS for some animations personalized styles which are in file styles.css and used react-router-dom for the navigation.
